# Helius Stream Module - Vault Creation Events

This module handles Helius webhook events specifically for **vault creation** on the Solana blockchain. It processes `vault_created` events and logs detailed information about new vault deployments.

## Overview

The Helius Stream module is designed to:
- Receive webhooks from Helius for vault creation events
- Process and log vault creation details
- Verify webhook signatures for security
- Provide a foundation for vault-related business logic

## Features

### ‚úÖ **Vault Creation Event Processing**
- Automatically detects `vault_created` event types
- Logs comprehensive vault information
- Extracts vault metadata, accounts, and configuration
- Skips non-vault events gracefully

### ‚úÖ **Security**
- Webhook signature verification
- Multiple authentication header support
- Configurable webhook secret

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Logging**
- Detailed vault creation event logs
- Asset allocation breakdowns
- Account information tracking
- Network and metadata details

## API Endpoints

### Webhook Endpoint
```http
POST /helius-stream/webhook
```

**Headers Required:**
- `x-signature` OR `x-webhook-auth` OR `authorization`

**Body:** Helius webhook payload (JSON)

## Event Types Handled

### üè¶ **Vault Created** (`vault_created`)
The primary event type that this module processes.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
HELIUS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

## Logging Output

When a vault creation event is received, the module logs:

```

## Integration Points

### Vault Factory Module
This module can be integrated with the Vault Factory module to:
- Automatically create vault records in the database
- Trigger vault initialization processes
- Update vault statuses

### Business Logic Extensions
You can extend the `processVaultCreationEvent` method to:
- Store vault data to external databases
- Send notifications to stakeholders
- Update analytics and reporting systems
- Trigger downstream processes

## Security Considerations

### Webhook Verification
The module supports multiple signature verification methods:
1. **Direct Secret Comparison**: If Helius sends the secret directly
2. **HMAC SHA256**: Standard webhook signature verification
3. **MD5 Hash**: Alternative hash verification method

### Authentication Headers
The module checks for signatures in multiple header locations:
- `x-signature`
- `x-webhook-auth`
- `authorization`

## Error Handling

The module includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid webhook signatures
- Missing authentication headers
- Malformed webhook data
- Processing failures

## Development

### Adding New Vault Event Types
To add support for additional vault-related events:

1. **Update the interface** in `helius-stream.service.ts`:
```typescript
if (webhookData.type === 'vault_created' || webhookData.type === 'vault_updated') {
  // Handle vault events
}
```

2. **Add processing methods** for new event types
3. **Update logging** to include new event details

### Testing
The module includes unit tests for:
- Webhook signature verification
- Event processing logic
- Error handling scenarios

## Example Usage

### Webhook Configuration
Configure your Helius webhook to point to:
```
https://your-domain.com/helius-stream/webhook
```

### Event Filtering
In your Helius dashboard, filter for:
- **Event Types**: `vault_created`
- **Program IDs**: Your vault factory program ID
- **Networks**: devnet/mainnet as needed

## Monitoring

### Log Monitoring
Monitor the application logs for:
- Webhook receipt confirmations
- Vault creation event details
- Processing success/failure rates
- Authentication verification results

### Metrics to Track
- Webhook volume
- Event processing success rate
- Response times
- Error rates by event type
